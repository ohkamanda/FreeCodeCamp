/*
Waypoint: Concatenate Arrays with concat

concat can be used to merge the contents of two arrays into one.

concat takes an array as an argument and returns a new array with the elements of this array concatenated onto the end.

Here is an example of concat being used to concatenate otherArray onto the end of oldArray:

newArray = oldArray.concat(otherArray);

Use .concat() to concatenate concatMe onto the end of oldArray and assign it to newArray.
*/

var oldArray = [1,2,3];
var concatMe = [4,5,6];

var newArray = oldArray.concat(concatMe);
